# Insurance Manual QA Project

This repository contains manual QA documentation for a sample **Insurance Management System** project. The goal is to showcase practical test planning and execution skills based on real-world project structure.

## Project Overview

The Insurance Management System is divided into 3 key modules:

1. **User Portal** – Customer-facing platform to manage policies and claims.
2. **Admin Panel** – Internal panel for administrators to manage users, policy records, claims, etc.
3. **Third-party Services** – External API integrations (e.g., Aadhaar verification, payment gateways).
